High Beam Assist is feature in Modern cars equipped with ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System). It employs RADAR senor and camera to track vehicle movements and suitabliy toggle High beam to low Beam.
I have tried to mimic the functionality with minimal setup using SR 04 ultrasonic sensor. This is more of a proof of concept.
